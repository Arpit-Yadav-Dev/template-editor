# 🧪 API Integration Test Results

## ✅ **Current Status**

### **Working APIs:**
1. **✅ Upload Image**: `POST /api/template-images-library`
   - Endpoint: `http://16.171.24.58/api/template-images-library`
   - Method: POST with FormData
   - Auth: Bearer token required
   - Status: **READY TO TEST**

### **Pending APIs:**
2. **⏳ Get Images**: Need GET endpoint for retrieving images
3. **⏳ Delete Image**: Need DELETE endpoint for removing images

## 🔧 **Current Implementation**

### **Upload Flow:**
```typescript
// When user uploads image in "My Images" category:
1. Image uploads to: POST /api/template-images-library
2. FormData includes: { image: File, folder?: string }
3. Auth header: Bearer token
4. Response: { url, id, filename }
5. Image appears in gallery immediately
```

### **Fallback System:**
```typescript
// If API upload fails:
1. Falls back to local storage
2. User can still use the image
3. No data loss
4. Seamless experience
```

## 🧪 **Test Instructions**

### **1. Test Upload:**
1. Open the editor: `http://localhost:5173`
2. Login with your credentials
3. Go to editor → Click image library
4. Switch to "My Images" category
5. Upload an image
6. Check if image appears in gallery

### **2. Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Image uploads to server
- ✅ Image appears immediately
- ✅ Image persists on page refresh
- ✅ Works with authentication

### **3. Debug Info:**
- Check browser Network tab for API calls
- Look for POST to `/api/template-images-library`
- Verify Bearer token is included
- Check response for success/error

## 📋 **API Endpoint Details**

### **Upload Endpoint:**
```bash
POST http://16.171.24.58/api/template-images-library
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer {token}
  Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body:
  image: File
  folder: "menu-editor" (optional)
```

### **Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": {
    "url": "https://server.com/images/image.jpg",
    "id": "img_123",
    "filename": "my-image.jpg"
  }
}
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate:**
1. **Test Upload**: Try uploading an image in the editor
2. **Verify Persistence**: Check if image survives page refresh
3. **Check Network**: Monitor API calls in browser dev tools

### **Future Enhancements:**
1. **Get Images API**: Add endpoint to retrieve user's images
2. **Delete API**: Add endpoint to remove images
3. **Image Management**: Add features like rename, organize folders

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

- ✅ Images upload successfully to server
- ✅ Images appear in gallery immediately  
- ✅ Images persist across browser sessions
- ✅ Authentication works properly
- ✅ Error handling works (fallback to local)

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Upload Fails:**
1. Check authentication token
2. Verify API endpoint is accessible
3. Check CORS settings
4. Review server logs

### **If Image Doesn't Appear:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API response format
3. Check image URL is accessible
4. Test with different image formats

## 📊 **Performance Notes**

- **Upload Speed**: Depends on image size and server
- **Fallback**: Local storage as backup
- **User Experience**: Seamless with progress indicators
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation
