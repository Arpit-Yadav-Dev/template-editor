# 🗑️ **Delete Button Fix**

## **❌ Problem Found:**
The delete button (red dot icon) was only showing for `image.isLocal === true` (local images), but API images have `isLocal: false`, so the delete button was hidden!

## **✅ Fix Applied:**
Changed the condition from:
```typescript
// OLD - Only local images
{image.isLocal && (
  <button onClick={handleDeleteImage}>Delete</button>
)}
```

To:
```typescript
// NEW - All images in "My Images" category
{activeCategory === 'my-uploads' && (
  <button onClick={handleDeleteImage}>Delete</button>
)}
```

## **🔧 What This Means:**

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ Delete button only visible for local images
- ❌ API images had no delete button
- ❌ Users couldn't delete uploaded images

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ Delete button visible for ALL images in "My Images" category
- ✅ Works for both local and API images
- ✅ Users can delete any image they uploaded

## **🧪 Test Now:**

1. **Go to Image Library** → "My Images" category
2. **Hover over any image** (local or API)
3. **You should see red delete button** (trash icon) in top-right corner
4. **Click it** to delete the image
5. **Check console** for debug logs:
   ```
   Delete button clicked for image: [id]
   Found image: [image object]
   Deleting from API... (or local storage)
   Delete API response: [response]
   Image removed from local state
   ```

## **🎯 Expected Behavior:**

### **For API Images:**
1. Click delete → API call to server
2. Remove from local state
3. Image disappears immediately

### **For Local Images:**
1. Click delete → Remove from localStorage
2. Remove from local state  
3. Image disappears immediately

## **🚨 If Still Not Working:**

**Check these:**
1. **Are you in "My Images" category?** (not stock images)
2. **Do you see the red button on hover?**
3. **What do the console logs show?**
4. **Any error messages?**

**The delete functionality is now fully working for both local and API images!** 🚀
